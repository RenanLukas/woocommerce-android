Viewing orders with products using WooCommerce’s Product Add-Ons Extension is a new feature! Head over to your store’s settings in the app on the My store tab and turn this on under Beta features. Be sure to send us feedback about the experience!

You’ll also find that you can filter the product list by category. You asked, and we delivered!
